> The extension provides simple command for refactoring CSS values to Style object and vice versa.

As react develoers, we find ourselves in a split world for styling. World of CSS syntax and JS style object syntax. More different projects you work on, the more pain it becomes. Especially if you need to change between the syntax often. This VSCode extension is here to rescue ⛑️. 

## Features



Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.
